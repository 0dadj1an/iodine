iodine - IP over DNS is now easy

   http://code.kryo.se/iodine

********************************

STUFF TO DO:

- Handle multiple concurrent users on one server

- Fragment downstream packets if 512 byte limit present

- Implement sliding window

- Use better encoding if dns servers preserve case

- Port to more platforms (Solaris? Windows?)

- More/better documentation (as always)

- Modify readname to take the actual size of the buffer to fill, and make sure it adds a '\0' at the end. Then clean up dns.c to match the changes.
